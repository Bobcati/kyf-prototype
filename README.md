# Know Your Farmer Prototype

The goal of this project is to develop prototype features for Fluid's upcoming Know Your Farmer Product. This product has 3 key objectives:

### 1. Build a Farmer Database
Extension officers and field agents can collect farmer information on mobile devices throughout the year, even for farmers who may not yet be eligible or willing to apply for a loan

### 2. Process More Loans
A database of registered farmers will expand the pool of potential applicants and will allow the bank to process more loan applications in less time

### 3. View Customer Credit History
Loan activity can be recorded on registered farmers profiles, this makes it easier for the bank to track performant and delinquent customers. This data can also be used to improve decision-making on loan applications.
